Gulp:
In terminal, run gulp to minify CSS and JS files (make sure to npm install first :-) ).  We left the other JS files commented out in case you want to uncomment.  If any libraries or js files are added outside of lib, make sure to add it to the gulp file.  Prior to production, you may want to use the unminified versions of js files so you can take advantage of ionic serve.
